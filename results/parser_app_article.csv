The talks took ""just a few weeks,"" he said.While the deal still requires approval from regulators and some additional due diligence, the parties are confident the transaction will get the green light from officials.""We would not be moving forward if we did not feel like we had regulatory support,"" he added.Regional lenders are also looking to diversify their revenue, strengthen balance sheets and expand in growing markets as they seek to compete with larger rivals.Comerica warmed to a deal because it saw the need to grow at a time when some competitors had already expanded through acquisitions, Farmer added.""We have always been focused primarily on organic growth,"" he said. ""What changed in the last two years was living through the situation with the regional bank crisis as a $78 billion bank and not having a large retail presence -- that was hard for us during the 2023 bank crisis,"" he said.The regional bank index(.KRX), opens new tabwas up over 1%.""I expect we will see more combinations amongst regional banks because we are in an environment where bank M&A of equals or near equals makes a lot of sense,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, partner and CIO at Running Point Capital Advisors.The latest transaction couldusher in more combinations, especially for banks with assets of up to $100 billion, two investment banking sources said.Two large regional lenders that have long been discussed asM&A candidateshave done deals in the last two months.Comerica has long been seen as a target, while PNC(PNC.N), opens new tabannouncedthe purchase of FirstBanklast month.Other banks that have been floated as deal candidates include Zions Bancorp(ZION.O), opens new tab, Flagstar(FLG.N), opens new tab, First Horizon(FHN.N), opens new tab, East West(EWBC.O), opens new tab, Popular(BPOP.O), opens new tab, Western Alliance(WAL.N), opens new taband Webster Financial(WBS.N), opens new tab, one of the sources said. Shares of First Horizon were up 3.6% and Flagstar was up almost 2%.""That group is going to outperform from a price point of view because there is a bid for them,"" said a banker who advises financial institutions, who said the companies' shares had been supported by deal speculation. The banker declined to be identified discussing specific companies.LIGHTER REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTAnalysts have saidconsolidation is crucial for smaller lendersto compete with the nation's banking giants, with regional banks looking to take advantage of a potentially lighter regulation under the Trump administration.Comerica shareholders will receive 1.8663 Fifth Third shares for each Comerica share, valuing the deal at $82.88 per share based on Fifth Third's closing price on October 3.""Following the acquisition, Fifth Third will rank among the top five banks in every major Midwest MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area),"" TD Cowen analysts said.The deal, adding to Fifth Third's large presence in the Midwest, will create a bank with $224 billion in deposits and $174 billion in loans. Shares in Comerica jumped nearly 14%, while Fifth Third fell about 1.4%.""Record bank stock prices have also allowed for a greater currency to do deals,"" said Stephen Biggar, analyst at Argus Research.The S&P 500 Banks Index(.SPXBK), opens new tabhas surged nearly 21% this year, outpacing the benchmark S&P 500's(.SPX), opens new tabroughly 14% rise, through the previous close.The deal comes months after activist investor HoldCo Asset Management revealed it hadbuilt a stakein Comerica and urged the lender to pursue a sale.Farmer did not comment on the pressure from the activist shareholder, but said that it was not a determining factor behind the deal.Three-year share performance of Fifth Third and ComericaCROWN JEWEL FRANCHISEMergers and acquisitions are seen as crucial for regional lenders seeking to become more competitive in the U.S., which has more than 4,400 banks.""This is a crown jewel middle market banking franchise,"" a Fifth Third executive said on a conference call, adding his optimism about building its consumer network.The deal, which would create a lender with $288 billion in combined assets, expands Fifth Third's reach to 17 of the 20 fastest-growing U.S. markets, including Texas, California and parts of the southeast.By 2030, more than half of the combined company's branches are expected to be located in these regions.""This combination marks a pivotal moment for Fifth Third as we accelerate our strategy to build density in high-growth markets and deepen our commercial capabilities,"" Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence said.Many lenders are looking to build more diverse businesses with steadier revenue from fees collected in wealth management, payments or treasury services, to reduce the reliance on revenue from interest payments.""This deal will accelerate FITB's expansion into high growth markets, and we believe FITB's consumer banking strength has the potential to improve growth in legacy CMA,"" Baird analysts said in a note.Farmer will assume the role of vice chair in the combined company, while Peter Sefzik, its chief banking officer, will lead Fifth Third's wealth and asset management business.The deal is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2026, after which three board members of Comerica will join Fifth Third's board.Fifth Third shareholders will own about 73% of the combined company.Goldman Sachs was the exclusive financial advisor to Fifth Third, while JPMorgan Securities and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods advised Comerica, with JPMorgan acting as lead advisor.Reporting by Manya Saini in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Arasu Kannagi Basil and Tatiana Bautzer in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski

But Karla Bos, an independent corporate governance consultant, told me some of those votes would count as ""against"" votes under Intel's voting standards.Better, she said, would be for the government's shares to be cast under what is called ""mirror voting"" whereby they would be proportionately voted in line with all other votes cast and neutralize the government's influence.Vanguard created a ""mirror voting, opens new tab"" policy choice for its own investors this year.Bos said the change would be more in the spirit of proxy voting, for investors to thoughtfully consider issues.

That is an amount UBS could tolerate, said two other people familiar with the bank's thinking.UBS on Tuesday reiterated its opposition to current proposals in itsofficial response to a new government consultationon the plans, calling them ""disproportionate"" and ""out of touch with reality"".Shares in the Swiss bank rose on Tuesday, gaining more than 1% by 1230 GMT and outpacing a 0.9% rise in the broader European financial sector(.SXFP), opens new tab.PROCESS STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GOAll the sources underlined that the process has a long way to go and nothing is decided. Reuters could not establish whether UBS and the government had discussed possible concessions together. Representatives from both have been invited to a parliamentary committee meeting in early November.The final decision on the legislation that will cement the new rules will not be made by parliament until next year at the earliest.The finance ministry said the government was sticking to its proposals and had not signalled a willingness to reduce the additional capital burden to about $15 billion.""The final decision will be made by parliament and, in the event of a referendum, by the people,"" the ministry added.UBS told Reuters it remained opposed to what it called an excessive increase in capital requirements and favoured ""targeted, proportionate and internationally aligned"" regulatory changes.""We're optimistic that a reasonable outcome can be achieved,"" UBS added.The bank expects authorities to examine feedback on proposed rules and consider alternatives, UBS executive Markus Ronner said on Tuesday, adding that Switzerland has historically implemented proportionate regulation. ""From that perspective, our hope is probably not unfounded.""Newspaper Schweiz am Wochenende said at the weekend that centrist and right-of-centre political parties were working on a compromise that pointed towards an extra capital burden of between $10 billion and $15 billion.""I am convinced that in the end we'll get a result that ensures a better balance between stability and competitiveness,"" said Roman Studer, CEO of the Swiss Bankers Association, based on discussions with banks, business leaders and lawmakers.UBS FOREIGN UNITS AT HEART OF CAPITAL DEBATEMuch of the added capital burden centres on the government's desire for UBS to capitalise its foreign subsidiaries to the tune of 100%, up from 60% now, a proposal due to reach parliament next year after a publicconsultation.One lawmaker pushing for tougher regulation said, on condition of anonymity, that parliament could eventually meet in the middle, with the requirement lowered to 80%.The source familiar with the government's thinking said an 80% threshold could be acceptable to Bern.Such a reduction would lower the extra capital needed close to $15 billion, said two analysts who have crunched the numbers.Another route to ease the burden would be to allow UBS to cover part of it with so-called Additional Tier 1 (AT1) debt instead of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital as proposed.UBS held about $19 billion in AT1 debt at the end of June.

That is an amount UBS could tolerate, said two other people familiar with the bank's thinking.PROCESS STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GOAll the sources underlined the process has a long way to go, and nothing is decided. Reuters could not establish whether UBS and the government had discussed possible concessions together. Representatives from both have been invited to a parliamentary committee meeting in early November.Draft legislation will only next year reach parliament, which will ultimately decide the rules.The finance ministry said the government was sticking to its proposals and had not signalled a willingness to reduce the additional capital burden to about $15 billion.""The final decision will be made by parliament and, in the event of a referendum, by the people,"" the ministry said.UBS said it remained opposed to what it called an excessive increase in capital requirements and favoured ""targeted, proportionate and internationally aligned"" regulatory changes.""We're optimistic that a reasonable outcome can be achieved,"" UBS added.Newspaper Schweiz am Wochenende said at the weekend centrist and right of centre political parties were working on a compromise that pointed towards an extra capital burden of $10-15 billion.""I am convinced that in the end we'll get a result that ensures a better balance between stability and competitiveness,"" said Roman Studer, CEO of the Swiss Bankers Association, based on discussions with banks, business leaders and lawmakers.UBS FOREIGN UNITS AT HEART OF CAPITAL DEBATEMuch of the added capital burden centres on the government's desire for UBS to capitalise its foreign subsidiaries to the tune of 100%, up from 60% now, a proposal due to reach parliament next year after a publicconsultation.One lawmaker pushing for tougher regulation said, on condition of anonymity, that parliament could eventually meet in the middle, with the requirement lowered to 80%.The source familiar with the government's thinking said an 80% threshold could be acceptable to Bern.Such a reduction would lower the extra capital needed close to $15 billion, two analysts who have crunched the numbers said.Another route to ease the burden would be allowing UBS to cover part of it with so-called Additional Tier 1 (AT1) debt instead of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital as proposed.UBS held around $19 billion in AT1 debt at the end of June. Incorporating that could lower the total add-on to a tolerable level for the bank, one source said.""It must be possible to use AT1 as collateral,"" SBA's Studer said.

Switzerland says more capital is needed so UBS can better absorb losses and stabilise itself in a crisis without taxpayer support.Bern also wants to improve the quality of UBS's core capital by excluding items such as software and deferred tax assets. UBS said it was against that exclusion, saying it destroyed capital without justification.The government will examine the comments from the bank, industry bodies and political parties before deciding on how to proceed.Reporting by John Revill; Editing by Kirsti Knolle, Miranda Murray and Jan HarveyOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tabSuggested Topics:Sustainable Finance & ReportingShareholder ActivismRegulatory OversightShareXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing Rights"

Workiva previouslyfielded interest from a private equity firmthree years ago.The hedge fund has not ruled out nominating directors if the two sides can't reach an agreement, the sources said.A representative for the company was not immediately available for comment while an Irenic representative declined to comment.IRENIC TARGETS WORKIVA AFTER STOCK DECLINEIrenic ranks among the top 10 investors in Workiva and its push for changes is becoming public less than three weeks after the company held its investor day.Workiva's stock price dropped 5.2% on September 9 as investors worried about management's commitment to profitability and their go-to-market efficiency, which measures a company's ability to drive revenue growth through sales and marketing investments, investors said. On the same day, the S&P 500 index was mostly flat.The company supplies top-of-the-line financial reporting tools used by roughly 90% of Fortune 500 companies, including soft drink maker Coca-Cola(KO.N), opens new tab, energy company Chevron(CVX.N), opens new taband United Airlines(UAL.O), opens new tab, to make filings with regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission.Since Julie Iskow became Workiva's CEO in April 2023, the company's stock price has fallen nearly 19% compared with a 20% average gain for its proxy peers and a 70% surge for the S&P 500 during the same period.Irenic has been frustrated with the company's financial performance with the company trading at a 27% discount to application software rivals like Workday(WDAY.O), opens new taband ServiceNow(NOW.N), opens new tab, the documents show.The hedge fund argues the discount is being fueled by a poor balance between growth and profitability, something it has asked management to address immediately, the sources added.IRENIC TARGETS WORKIVA'S LONG-SERVING DIRECTORSIrenic has twice sent letters to Workiva's board to lay out its concerns and proposed improvements, the people said.The hedge fund also expressed considerable concern about the company's governance, noting that five of its seven directors have served on the board since 2014.It is highly unusual for Irenic to join the board of a public company and in the three years since its launch, its executives have sat on only two public company boards.The firm was founded by former Elliott Investment Management executive Adam Katz and former Indaba Capital Management executive Andy Dodge and has been involved when companies like Arconic, Barnes and Couchbase went private and mounted activist engagements at News Corp(NWSA.O), opens new taband Theravance Biopharma(TBPH.O), opens new tab.Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Lisa ShumakerOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tabSuggested Topics:Sustainable Finance & ReportingBoardsShareholder ActivismShareXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing Rights"

Its ""Below 2-Degrees"" scenario, a reference to the aim of limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius in line with Paris Agreement goals, envisions about a 90% drop in carbon emissions by 2050 from 2023 levels.Emissions are largely the result of burning oil, natural gas and coal.The following are highlights from the report:OIL DEMAND, OIL PRODUCTIONGlobal oil demand is expected to hit 103.4 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2030 in BP's Current Trajectory, before falling to 83 million bpd by 2050.BP'sreportlast year had forecast demand peaking by 2025 at around 102 million bpd, but slowing efficiency gains have changed the picture.If weak energy efficiency gains persist, oil demand increases to about 106 million bpd by 2035.In its Below 2-Degrees scenario, oil demand peaks this year at 102.2 million bpd before falling to 33.8 million bpd by 2050.In the Current Trajectory, U.S. onshore production is broadly flat at around 15 million bpd over the first half of the outlook.

The SEC's response could prompt other companies to follow suit. Several activists said they worry the new option could give Exxon an unfair edge in corporate elections.Sign uphere.The oil major has fought back aggressively against activists in recent years, and could shore up more support from its unusually large base of retail shareholders - who typically have lower turnout rates but vote overwhelmingly in support of Exxon's board.Individual investors currently ""lack access to numerous services that make voting fast and easy for larger institutional investors. Activist groups often exploit this gap to push political goals at the expense of shareholder value,"" Exxon said in a statement.In the coming weeks, retail investors will be notified through their brokerages that they can enroll in a free program to vote their shares in line with management recommendations, Exxon said in a statement.If investors change their minds, they can override the program and cast their votes manually according to instructions in the proxy materials. Exxon said it is the first U.S. company to offer such an option.""As a matter of fairness, it's time to level the playing field,"" the company said.Nearly 40% of the company's shares are held by individuals but just a quarter of them vote during proxy season, though they mostly support the board, Exxon said.Retail investors hold about 30% of most large U.S. companies. They are a sought-after pool when companies face close board elections or campaigns for ideologically charged shareholder resolutions. Only a few other iconic U.S. brands approach Exxon's level of retail ownership including Apple andTesla.FIGHTING BACK AGAINST ACTIVISTSExxon has faced several high-profile activist shareholder campaigns tied to climate issues in recent years, notably in 2021 whenthree dissident directorswere elected to its board.Last year, it continued to pursue litigation against activist investors Arjuna Capital and Follow This, even after the groups withdrew their proposal calling onExxon to cut its greenhouse gas emissions.On Monday, Follow This founder Mark van Baal said via email that Exxon's new voting mechanism ""appears to be another attempt to suppress the voices of critical investors.""He said he hopes large institutional investors would speak out against the change. “If management can auto-capture retail votes, active investors lose influence when change is needed,"" van Baal said.Representatives for BlackRock(BLK.N), opens new taband Vanguard, among Exxon's top investors, did not immediately respond to questions.Tim Smith, a senior policy advisor to the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, whose members include Arjuna Capital, said Exxon's retail-voting program stands in contrast to those from two fund firms that allow clients to vote across a range ofother policiesincluding choices that support more climate and social measures.Exxon's effort ""seems to be an attempt to lock in support from individual shareholders rather than empower them to thoughtfully and actively join the proxy process,"" Smith said.Exxon's most recent annual meeting in May featuredno qualifying shareholder resolutionsfor the first time since 1958, following its aggressive campaign against resolution-filers.During an energy conference in Austin on Friday, Exxon CEO Darren Woods said the company wanted to stop activists from submitting the same proposal year after year.""My view is, if you're going to play that game, we can play too,"" Woods said.Reporting by Sheila Dang in Houston and Ross Kerber in Boston; Editing by Nathan Crooks and Lisa ShumakerOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tabSuggested Topics:Sustainable Finance & ReportingCorporate GovernanceShareholder ActivismRegulatory OversightRefiningShareXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing RightsRoss KerberThomson ReutersRoss Kerber is U.S. Sustainable Business Correspondent for Reuters News, a beat he created to cover investors’ growing concern for environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, and the response from executives and policymakers.

To receive the full newsletter in your inbox for freesign up here.Hello!Sign uphere.Energy and the environment are in focus in today’s newsletter as Ethiopia has officially inaugurated Africa's largest hydroelectric dam.The project willprovide energy to millions, but not without some diplomatic consequences.Let’s get into the positives first.Ethiopia, the continent's second most populous nation with over 120 million people, sees the $5 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on a tributary of the Nile as central to its economic ambitions.The dam's output has gradually increased since the first turbine was turned on in 2022, and it reached its maximum 5,150 MW of power on Tuesday.That puts it among the 20 biggest hydroelectric dams in the world, at about one-quarter of the capacity of China's Three Gorges Dam.Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has said the dam will improve access to electricity for almost half the population and will export the surplus to the region.The dam's reservoir will provide a steady water supply for irrigation downstream while limiting floods and drought.Now for the not-so-positives.Ethiopia's downstream neighbours have watched the project advance with dread since construction began in 2011.Egypt, which built its own Aswan High Dam on the Nile in the 1960s, fears the GERD could restrict its water supply during droughts, and could encourage the construction of other upstream dams.Its Foreign Ministry wrote to the U.N. Security Council saying the inauguration of the dam violated international law.Sudan, meanwhile, has joined Egypt's calls for legally binding agreements on the dam's filling and operation – but could also benefit from better flood management and access to cheap energy.Independent research shows that so far, no major disruptions to downstream flow have been recorded, noting favourable rainfall but also the cautious filling of the reservoir during wet seasons over a five-year period.WHAT TO WATCH​A Staten Island Compost Facility is taking the saying “one man's trash is another man’s treasure” to a whole new level as they are turning watermelon rinds, greasy pizza boxes, and yard trimmings into the raw ingredients for something surprisingly valuable: ""black gold.""Click here, opens new tabto watch a Reuters video about New York City’s food waste solution orclick hereto read the full article.NUMBER OF THE WEEK$137 billionThat’s the record amountmultilateral development banksprovided in climate finance in 2024, up 10% from the previous year, and also helped boost private sector funding for climate-related investments by a third, a report by the banks showed.CLIMATE LENSMap depicting Energy and Climate Security Risk Score across the EUWe’re continuing today’s focus on power in today’s climate lens with a look at Europe’s Energy and Climate Security Risk Index (ECSRI) which shows how progress toward clean, secure and affordable supply is highly uneven across the continent.The report, developed by the Center for the Study of Democracy (CSD), measures energy security across four pillars: geopolitics, affordability, reliability and sustainability.

But in the near term it must first improve its beverages business which has lost ground to rivals like Keurig Dr Pepper's(KDP.O), opens new tabDr. Pepper, the hedge fund said in a letter to the company's board on September 2.However, three long-term investors said that separating bottling is costly and could take years, further weighing on PepsiCo’s margins and earnings over that time.""It seems unlikely that the current management team has the readiness to refranchise,” said Kai Lehmann, portfolio manager at Flossbach von Storch, one of PepsiCo’s top 30 shareholders, who agreed the move looks attractive at first sight but said it would hurt margins for some time.Elliott and PepsiCo are having ongoing conversations about Elliott's proposal, said a source close to the matter who was not authorized to publicly speak about it.PepsiCo said it maintains an active dialogue with shareholders and that it will review Elliott's presentation.Elliott said in its presentation that operating margins in PepsiCo's North American beverage business trail Coca-Cola's by as much as 10 percentage points, which the company could recoup if it refranchised.A bar chart showing Coca-Cola's operating margins 2020-2024A bar chart showing PepsiCo's operating marginsPepsiCo's operating margins were 14% last year, up from 13.1% in 2023. Coke reported operating margins of 21.2% and 24.7% for the same time periods.New York-based PepsiCo, whose namesake cola is the second-largest soda brand globally, has struggled to revive sales in the United States as consumers push back on price hikes and smaller sizes of its products.Its shares rose more than 6% when Elliott revealed its position on September 2 but have since lost all gains and are down more than 10% since then.Elliott declined to comment.STATUS QUO NOT ACCEPTABLEPepsiCo, led by CEO Ramon Laguarta since 2018, has been trying to better integrate its chips and sodas divisions, which now operate as almost separate companies, to cut costs.The consumer giant has also acquired low-calorie soda Poppi and Mexican-American food maker Siete in an effort to appeal to consumers adopting healthier lifestyles.While Elliott has not put a deadline on exactly when and how it wants PepsiCo to overhaul itself, its involvement signals that the hedge fund is unhappy with the status quo and frustrated by a perceived lack of urgency from its management and the board.So far, Elliott has not criticized Pepsi's management team or board publicly, but investors said they recall from other campaigns that the hedge fund can quickly ratchet up the pressure if its push for changes is flatly ignored.Investors and analysts viewed more favorably Elliott's suggestion that Pepsi lose some of its smaller brands.Selling oatmeal label Quaker, acquired in 2001 with sports drink Gatorade for $13.4 billion in stock, would likely fetch around $6 billion, Lehmann said.That money – and savings the company finds by abandoning poorly performing products – could help compensate for the fall in margins stemming from the process of divesting bottling, the investors and analysts said.Two PepsiCo franchisees who declined to be named said they think the company should separate its company-owned bottlers because local businesses provide better service to nearby retailers.PepsiCo frequently moves around executives before they can build relationships with customers, one of the franchisees said.PepsiCo acquired its largest bottlers more than 15 years ago in an approximately $7.8 billion deal which it said at the time would help it speed up decision-making and lead to annual savings.When Coca-Cola refranchised itsnetwork of bottlers in 2017, an effort that took more than five years, its sales and profit temporarily dropped as it offloaded revenue-generating businesses, although margins eventually improved.""It's a cost the company has to bear without immediate return on invested capital,"" said Dave Wagner, portfolio manager at PepsiCo shareholder Aptus Capital Advisors.Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli and Svea Herbst-Bayliss in New York; Editing by Matthew LewisOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tabSuggested Topics:Sustainable Finance & ReportingMergers & AcquisitionsShareholder ActivismCorporate CounselCorporate GovernanceShareXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing RightsJessica DiNapoliThomson ReutersNew York-based reporter covering U.S. consumer products and the companies that make them, and the role they play in the economy.

While climate and social questions have taken up less bandwidth at corporate annual meetings lately, items on corporate governancecontinue to win support. Both Vanguard and BlackRock ended support for nearly all climate and social resolutions in previous years, a pattern that continued in 2025.TALK LESS, SMILE MOREThe new SEC guidance tells managers to file more complex, expensive forms to report major holdings if they exert ""pressure on management"" such astying director votes, opens new tabto whether a company has a staggered board or undertakes certain environmental policies.The reporting requirement could also be triggered if the fund firm ""states or implies"" it will not support directors unless a company makes changes in line with a fund's voting policy.An SEC representative declined to comment.The shift mainly affectedBlackRock and Vanguard, whose combined $22 trillion means both firms often own more than 5% of stock issuers, the filing threshold.

Top investment firms ""have always been hesitant to disclose to the company how they’re going to vote. Now they're hesitant to signal their thinking on the issues,"" Schulman said.BlackRock has not given a quarterly count of its meetings. In its recent report, it said at the meetings its stewardship team ""listened to company directors and executives to understand how they are overseeing material business risks and opportunities,"" and that it may convey concerns through its AGM votes.Last year's report paints BlackRock's stewardship team as being more outspoken. Where it had concerns, the fund manager said at the time, ""we typically raise these through dialogue with board members and management teams first.""Asked for comment, a BlackRock representative noted its paststatementthat ""does not use engagement as a way to control publicly traded companies.""For Vanguard, anAug. 21 report, opens new tabshowed the Pennsylvania firm met with 356 companies worldwide from April through June this year, down 44% from the 640 in the same period in 2024.

As a result, Sabadell believes that BBVA's assumptions on the new cost-saving target of 900 million euros in 2029 rather than 850 million in 2028 areover-optimistic.Sabadell's board said it therefore identified a ""risk of loss of revenue or dis-synergies, together with the lack of certainty about the execution of the proposed merger"".Martinez said the measures adopted by the Spanish government will inevitably delay cost savings, and ""I hope that the ever-changing political landscape will reconsider the restrictions imposed in the event of a successful transaction.""He requested that BBVA reconsider and submit a competitive offer at a price that would achieve the acceptance of at least 50% of Banco Sabadell's shareholders.If BBVA decided to withdraw this 50% threshold condition, and it reached between 30% and 50% of Sabadell shareholder acceptance, under the Spanish takeover legislation it would be forced to submit another offer with the alternative in cash.In this regard, Sabadell said that BBVA may be obliged to launch a cash takeover bid at a fair price, in which case BBVA would likely have to increase its capital by issuing a significant number of new shares on the market.($1 = 0.8516 euros)Reporting by Jesús Aguado; additional reporting by Emma Pinedo; Editing by Inti Landauro, Joe Bavier and Susan FentonOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tabSuggested Topics:Sustainable Finance & ReportingShareholder ActivismShareXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing Rights"

""The Board needs immediate refreshment and must commence a robust strategic alternatives process to unlock value for shareholders.""Tarsadia traditionally does not call for its portfolio companies to pursue dramatic changes like a sale or liquidation. But after months of constructive conversation with Sunstone's management and board and visiting all of the company's properties, it is dialing up the pressure now after hitting an impasse in negotiations, two people familiar with Tarsadia said.The firm sees no path forward for the company in its current state and senses an industry inflection point with more buying and selling ahead, especially after lodging REIT Braemar Hotels & Resorts(BHR.N), opens new tablast month announced a sales process, the letter said.Sunstone did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The company's biggest problem, Tarsadia said, is that its portfolio, which includes the Marriott Boston Long Wharf, the Four Seasons Napa Valley, the Hilton San Diego Bayfront, and the Wailea Beach Resort, is too small and therefore not fully attractive to public market investors.There are 14 properties, down from a peak of 60 in 2005. Since its public listing in 2004, Sunstone's stock price has tumbled 44%, leaving it with a market value of $1.8 billion.

This column is part of the weekly Reuters Sustainable Finance newsletter, which you can sign up forhere.Would-be corporate vote reformers keep running into the same problem: it's all so darn complicated for the individual investor. Maybe reformers should be careful what they wish for.Sign uphere.If a typical U.S. public stock issuer stages a vote on 9 ballot items at its annual meeting, shareholders in index funds like the Vanguard 500(VOO.P), opens new tabcould face 4,500 decisions a year about how to vote items on proxy ballots at corporate annual meetings. Who could parse all that out?A forthcoming paper by a group of business and law professors from Duke, the University of Florida and Columbia refers to this as the problem of ""rational apathy,"" the idea that shareholders won't waste their time figuring out how to cast complicated votes with little impact.Instead, fund companies to date handle the voting themselves. Nobody used to care but environmental and social reformers. Then, U.S. conservatives realized they could pressure companies and asset managers over how theycast these ballots.Top managers might dodge the line of fire by using ""pass-through""voting programs, opens new taballowing fund investors to influence some of the proxy ballots funds cast at corporate annual meetings.In a briefing with journalists this week, for instance, Vanguard stewardship chief John Galloway said that 82,000 individual investors used its Voting Choice program during the 12 months ended June 30, about double the number from the same period a year ago. They voted shares worth $9 billion, triple the amountlast year.Vanguard investors spread out their votes as new policy options were addedThat's still a drop in the bucket compared to Vanguard's 50 million investors and $11 trillion in total assets under management.But get ready for things to take off. Galloway said Vanguard has begun working with corporate sponsors to offer voting choice to 401(k)-type retirement plan participants. He also released new figures showing investors dispersing their votes across a wider range of vote-policy choices including a new Egan-Jones policywith anti-ESG criteria, opens new tab.""We can see investors emphatically demonstrating the 'choice' in Investor Choice this year,"" Galloway said.PUMPING UP THE BOSSESReformers pushing for things like reining in CEO pay have high hopes the shift will move power away from fund managers who tend to not rock the boat since, for one thing, they earn fees managing corporate retirement accounts.But in the draft paper, the academics write a surprising consequence of more pass-through voting could be to increase the power of boards, since individual investors tend to choose policies that support management.They cite two close votes that played out at Tesla(TSLA.O), opens new tablast year. Shareholders narrowly approved measures calling on the electric carmaker to cut its director terms to one year from three years, and to require only simple majority votes for certain governance shifts rather than the current two-thirds standard.Vanguard's main stewardship team backed both measures. Of those shares participating in last year's pilot-voting program, 36% either abstained or supported management. Had that 36% applied to all of Vanguard's index equity funds, both proposals would have fallen just under the 50% threshold needed by both items, the authors found.As proxy vote choice programs grow, ""the realities of a changed ecosystem become more and more likely,"" the authors write.Columbia University Law School professor Dorothy Lund, one of the authors, said in an interview there's much to be said for pass-through voting as a way to empower engaged investors who disagree with their managers' voting.But most mutual fund investors don't really want to think about their holdings in the first place, let alone how to vote their proxies. For that reason the new voting policies could mainly empower proxy advisers, which in time could include financial online influencers - ""FinFluencers"" - putting their voting recommendations on TikTok.In theory more competition would lead to better choices, Lund said. A danger, she said, is that proxy voting becomes so free-ranging that companies don't know which shareholders to listen to.""Implementation of a truly open proxy could lead to complete fragmentation, where the issuers don't know who to speak with because nobody's really directing the vote,"" Lund said.Reporting by Ross Kerber; Editing by David GregorioOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tabSuggested Topics:Asian MarketsESG InvestorsBoardsShareholder ActivismClimate ChangeOpinions expressed are those of the author.

Such a proposal would have been unthinkable under the Biden administration, which had an aggressive antitrust policy.Sign uphere.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump's support could accelerate the lengthy review process, in a deal that faces resistance from rivals and pushback from shippers concerned about reduced competition.The deal, if approved, could reshape the U.S. freight rail industry by creating the first coast-to-coast single-line network, streamlining operations and eliminating interchange delays in key hubs like Chicago.In the White House meeting, Trump and Vena discussed ""how creating an American transcontinental railroad is a win for U.S. competition, consumers, and the unionized workers whose jobs will be protected when the merger is approved,"" the company said in a statement.Vena said at a Morgan Stanley conference on Wednesday that he had meetings with ""very senior people in the administration"" the day before, without naming them.""They get it. They understand the value of what we are proposing. And they think it is an absolute win-win for the country,"" Vena said during the conference.Union Pacific sought administration input prior to launching its bid, and received signals of support to move forward, people briefed on the talks said.Trump said on Friday on Fox News that he met with Vena because the CEO wanted to discuss the merger with him.RIVALS BOXED INUnion Pacific dominates freight rail operations in the western United States, while Norfolk Southern is a leading carrier in the East. Together, they form two of the four major U.S. Class I railroads, alongside BNSF Railway and CSX Corp(CSX.O), opens new tab.When Union Pacific and Norfolk announced the merger, the industry expected the two remaining regional rivals to respond by rushing to join forces to compete against a continental giant.But billionaire Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway owns BNSF Railway, sent a strong signal last monthagainst further consolidationand said he was not interested in buying another railroad. BNSF recentlyexpanded commercial agreementswith CSX instead of pursuing a merger.CSX, meanwhile, faces pressure from activist investors to make strategic changes, including potentialM&Aactivity. Both companies are closely watching how regulators respond to the Union Pacific-Norfolk merger before making any moves.Signs of the White House's support could force Buffett to revisit his strategy.BNSF, strong in the West, and CSX, dominant in the East, could remain the only major U.S. carriers that are not part of a transcontinental system.The White House said on Thursday it was nominating Surface Transportation Board member Michelle Schultz for a new term and Richard Kloster, who heads a private transportation consulting company, to an open seat at the agency.The White House last month fired Surface Transportation Board member Robert Primus, an appointee of former President Joe Biden.The dismissal was the strongest signal possible of White House support for the deal, a person close to the transaction said.Reporting by Sabrina Valle in New York and David Shepardson; Editing by Richard ChangOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tabSuggested Topics:Sustainable Finance & ReportingShareholder ActivismRegulatory OversightShareXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing RightsSabrina ValleThomson ReutersNY-based correspondent reporting on some of the largest deals in Healthcare and Industrials.

Ainda assim, os investidores reagiram negativamente, com as ações da Kraft Heinz caindo mais de 6% no início esta tarde, em meio a um movimento mais amplo de venda de ações no mercado.A fusão de 2015 arquitetada pela parceria entre a empresa de private equity 3G Capital - dos bilionários brasileiros Jorge Paulo Lemann, Carlos Alberto Sicupira e Marcel Telles; e a Berkshire Hathaway(BRKa.N), opens new tab, de Warren Buffett - foi criada com o objetivo de cortar custos e impulsionar o crescimento de marcas icônicas, como o Heinz, Jell-O e cream cheese Philadelphia.Não funcionou. Desde a fusão, as ações perderam cerca de 60% de seu valor, pressionadas em parte por redução de gastos dos consumidores, principalmente após a pandemia.Buffett disse à CNBC nesta terça-feira que estava ""desapontado"" com a divisão. A fusão não se revelou uma ideia brilhante, mas desmembrar a empresa não resolverá seus problemas, disse ele.No mês passado, a Berkshire realizou uma redução de US$3,76 bilhões em sua participação de 27,4% na empresa.""A complexidade de nossa estrutura atual torna desafiadora a alocação eficaz de capital, a priorização de iniciativas e o aumento de escala em nossas áreas mais promissoras"", disse o português Miguel Patricio, presidente-executivo do conselho da Kraft Heinz, que já foi chefe de marketing da cervejaria brasileira Ambev .A empresa registrou US$9,3 bilhões em perdas no segundo trimestre devido ao declínio sustentado no preço de suas ações e no valor de mercado.""Para os investidores, a mudança pode desbloquear valor no curto prazo, mas os riscos de execução são claros: a menos que ambas as entidades invistam em inovação e se defendam contra a invasão de marcas próprias, a separação pode não conseguir mais do que uma melhora financeira temporário"", disse Suzy Davidkhanian, analista da Emarketer.Failed mega-merger: Kraft Heinz vs S&P 500MENOS COMPLEXAA divisão ajudará a ""alocar o nível certo de atenção e recursos para liberar o potencial de cada marca"", disse Patricio nesta terça-feira.A divisão cria uma empresa focada em molhos e pastas, como Heinz, Philadelphia e Kraft Mac & Cheese, que teve vendas de cerca de US$15,4 bilhões em 2024. A outra companhia consistiria em alimentos processados e marcas de refeições prontas, incluindo Oscar Mayer e Lunchables, com cerca de US$10,4 bilhões em vendas anuais.A unidade de mercearia será dirigida pelo atual chefe da Kraft Heinz, Carlos Abrams-Rivera, enquanto a empresa busca possíveis candidatos a presidente-executivo para a unidade de molhos.""Continuamos céticos quanto ao fato de que essa separação, por si só, ajudará as empresas individualmente"", disse Max Gumport, analista do BNP, observando que os desafios que sustentam o fraco desempenho podem levar muitos anos de investimentos e melhorias para serem superados.A empresa espera que a divisão custe até US$300 milhões, mas prevê a redução rápida de grande parte dessa despesa.Na semana passada, a gigante norte-americana de refrigerantes Keurig Dr Pepper(KDP.O), opens new tabanunciou a aquisição da JDE Peet's(JDEP.AS), opens new tabpor US$18 bilhões. O negócio resultará na divisão das operações de café e de outros negócios de bebidas da entidade resultante da fusão em duas empresas separadas de capital aberto.Kraft Heinz lagged rivals((Tradução Redação São Paulo, 55 11 56447753))REUTERS AAJOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tabSuggested Topics:NegócioShareXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing Rights"

He needs to do better M&A and focus more on emerging markets.""Freixe, a 63-year-old Frenchman, was sacked just over a year after his predecessor Mark Schneider was ousted for failing to turn Nestle around.The company also said in June that Paul Bulcke, CEO from 2008 to 2016, willstep down as chairin April 2026 and be replaced by Pablo Isla, a former CEO of Spanish fashion retailer Inditex.Freixe's dismissal follows an investigation into an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate that breached Nestle's(NESN.S), opens new tabcode of business conduct, Nestle said late onMonday.Shares in the maker of Nescafe instant coffee and KitKat chocolate bars closed 0.7% lower in Zurich, paring earlier losses when the stock fell as much as 3.6%.SPEAK UPThe company said concerns about a possible relationship were first raised by staff via the company's internal reporting channel Speak Up, although an initial investigation was unsubstantiated.Freixe initially denied the relationship to the board, a company spokesperson said.When staff concerns persisted, Nestle ordered an investigation, overseen by Bulcke and Isla, with the support of Swiss lawyers Baer & Karrer, Nestle said.The report was completed in recent days, leading to a board meeting and Freixe's dismissal on Monday.Freixe, who spent 39 years with Nestle, will receive no exit package following his departure, the company told Reuters.In a short statement, Bulcke thanked Freixe for his service at Nestle, but said the dismissal was a ""necessary decision"".Item 1 of 2 Nestle CEO Laurent Freixe attends the Annual General Meeting of Nestle in Ecublens near Lausanne, Switzerland, April 16, 2025.

The female subordinate, whose identity has not been made public, left Nestle over the summer, a company spokesperson said.Swiss law does not prohibit relationships between senior executives, although most large companies - including Nestle - have internal codes of conduct that require them to be disclosed. If there is a conflict of interest, one of the people has to switch roles.At Nestle, direct reporting relationship between family members, partners and close associates is not allowed, while indirect reporting lines are assessed on a case-by-case basis.Corporate governance expert Peter V Kunz, from the University of Bern, said he was not familiar with Nestle's rules, but that requirements at most public companies were broadly similar.""In this respect, Mr Freixe's behaviour – regardless of whether it was legal or not – seems to me to be simply stupid and incomprehensible in this day and age,"" Kunz told Reuters, adding that he did not think investors had grounds for legal action against Nestle.STABILITY SOUGHTAs price-sensitive consumers have turned to cheaper alternatives, Nestle's shares, a bedrock of the Swiss stock exchange, have lost almost a third of their value over the past five years, underperforming European peers.Freixe's appointment failed to halt the slide, with the company's shares shedding 17% during his leadership, disappointing investors.One top-20 Nestle investor said Freixe had been a disappointment and that bringing in Navratil was an opportunity for a more ambitious overhaul.The new CEO needs to slim down the company, cut costs and above all reduce the headcount, said the investor who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. It was also crucial that the company raise organic growth to boost volumes.In July, Nestlelaunched a reviewof its underperforming vitamins business that could lead to the divestment of some brands after first-half sales volumes missed expectations.AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said that the company would likely face a period of uncertainty.""While Navratil is also an internal appointment, he will want to put his own mark on strategy and that suggests the clock could be reset when it comes to the turnaround plan,"" he said.Writing by John Revill, Dave Graham and Louise Heavens; additional reporting by Paolo Laudani; Editing by Andrea Ricci, Muralikumar Anantharaman, Louise Heavens, Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Barbara LewisOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tabSuggested Topics:StocksCorporate GovernanceBoardsPolitical LobbyingCorporate CounselShareXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing Rights"

Der aktivistische Investor Teleios Capital, der nach eigenen Angaben fast 25 Prozent an Norma hält, begrüßte den Verkauf.Denn von dem Deal sollen auch die Norma-Aktionäre profitieren: Das Unternehmen rechnet mit einem Netto-Mittelzufluss von 620 bis 640 Millionen Euro. Knapp die Hälfte davon soll zum Schuldenabbau verwendet werden, bis zu 70 Millionen hat Norma für Zukäufe im Kerngeschäft mit Industrieanwendungen reserviert. ""Der Vorstand plant, den verbleibenden Teil des Netto-Mittelzuflusses an die Aktionäre zurückzuführen"", möglicherweise zunächst durch einen Aktienrückkauf, hieß es in der Mitteilung. Rechnerisch müsste Norma insgesamt mehr als acht Euro je Aktie ausschütten. Die im Kleinwerteindex SDax(.SDAXI), opens new tabnotierte Norma-Aktie brach indes um mehr als sechs Prozent ein.Teleios-Investmentdirektor Benjamin Schmid sprach von einem ""Meilenstein"" für Norma. Damit treibe das Unternehmen seinen Umbau voran und schaffe Wert für die Aktionäre. Der Investor war vor drei Jahren bei Norma eingestiegen, als die Aktie um fast zwei Drittel auf gut 13 Euro eingebrochen war, und war anschließend zum größten Aktionär aufgestiegen. Teleios dürfte auf den Verkauf gedrängt haben. Auch Norma-Chef Mark Wilhelms sieht ihn positiv: Das Unternehmen sei nun ""auf dem Weg hin zu einem fokussierten Industriezulieferer"". Mit dem Erlös werde Norma schuldenfrei. ""Damit stellen wir das Unternehmen auf ein noch solideres finanzielles Fundament und erlangen mehr Flexibilität für den Ausbau unseres Industriegeschäfts.""SCHWERPUNKT DES GESCHÄFTS LIEGT IN DEN USADas Geschäft mit Be- und Entwässerungstechnik war seit 2012 durch Übernahmen aufgebaut worden. 90 Prozent des Umsatzes der Sparte werden in den USA erzielt. Die Kunden stammen vor allem aus der Landwirtschaft. ADS steigt mit der Übernahme ins Geschäft mit Garten- und Landschaftsbewässerung ein. Damit entwickle sich ADS weiter vom Rohrproduzenten zum Lösungsanbieter für den Umgang mit Regen- und Abwasser, sagte Vorstandschef Scott Barbour. Im vergangenen Jahr setzte die Norma-Sparte mit 1100 Mitarbeitern 320 Millionen Dollar um, bei einem bereinigten operativen Ergebnis (Ebitda) von 78 Millionen. Der neue Eigentümer aus dem US-Bundesstaat Ohio verspricht sich Synergieeffekte von 25 Millionen Dollar.Vollzogen werden soll der Verkauf Anfang 2026, das Wassermanagement-Geschäft wird aber schon aus den Umsatz- und Gewinnprognosen für 2025 ausgeklammert. Norma erwartet nun einen Umsatz von 810 bis 830 Millionen Euro. Einschließlich der zum Verkauf stehenden Sparte waren es 1,1 bis 1,2 Milliarden. Unter dem Strich bleibt kaum Gewinn: Die bereinigte operative Umsatzrendite (Ebit-Marge) werde bei maximal einem Prozent liegen.
